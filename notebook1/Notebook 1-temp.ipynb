This notebook will provide a gentle introduction to Python (a coding language) and Jupyter (the platform you are currently using) through the analysis and visualization of some basic COVID-19 data. You won't have to be answering any coding questions yourself in the notebooks for this class, but instead you'll be asked to answer some short-answer questions as we explore and visualize the data. Any questions you see in yellow-shaded sections below are questions you'll be answering! We hope that going through this notebook provides a useful and interesting first look into how important data collection of a virus like COVID-19 is."
