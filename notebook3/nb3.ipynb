As its name implies, it is a virus that only infects humans, and it can affect people by weakening their immune system, making their bodies less capable of fighting off viruses and bacteria. If a person with HIV does not treat and control it, **it can lead to AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome** and is the most severe stage of HIV. Although HIV cannot be completely cured, it is important for people with HIV to have it treated and controlled. HIV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with infected blood and other certain body fluids."
