In the previous notebook, we went through a basic introduction of how to use Python and Jupyter Notebooks for this course, as well as doing some introductory exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data while considering the contexts, circumstances, and potential issues of the data collection and representation. In this notebook, we'll continue using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to explore HIV and AIDS data. We will especially focus on what we can learn about our data from the historical context, what we can learn about historical context from our data, and how both of these aspects can complement each other."

As its name implies, it is a virus that only infects humans, and it can affect people by weakening their immune system, making their bodies less capable of fighting off viruses and bacteria. If a person with HIV does not treat and control it, **it can lead to AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome** and is the most severe stage of HIV. Although HIV cannot be completely cured, it is important for people with HIV to have it treated and controlled. HIV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with infected blood and other body fluids."

By early 1983, the CDC started to discover that most cases of HIV were comprised of gay men and injection drug users.
